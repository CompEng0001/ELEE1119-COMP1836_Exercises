- [COMP1836 Submission Link](https://moodlecurrent.gre.ac.uk/mod/turnitintooltwo/view.php?id=2876034)

## Learning Outcomes

On completion of the assignment, the student will develop:

1. Understanding of the basic principles of mobile app design.

2. Skills in designing a mobile app.

## The Task

This assignment consists of two tasks:

1. **Task 1**: Investigating the main principles of mobile app design using a variety of literature sources (e.g., books, journal articles, online resources, best practice documentation, accessibility documentation, etc.). Find 5 to 10 relevant literature sources related to the main principles of mobile app design, analyse them, and write up a list of the main design principles and features that a good mobile app should have to appeal to customers. Explain how you are going to incorporate these features in the app you will be developing. 

2. **Task 2**: Design a mobile app for managing daily tasks. Explain how you have created the design, specifying the theme you have chosen, the type of layout used, and the steps taken in developing the app design. Include a picture of the running version of the app using the emulator. Note that the primary focus of this task is the design and appearance of the app, not a fully functioning app.

### The app should have the following features:

- An opening screen with a title and navigation options.

- A screen to add, edit, and delete tasks with fields for the task name, description, and due date.

- A dynamic ImageView to display icons or images related to different task categories.

- A summary screen showing a list of tasks and their statuses.

- Use a theme that displays an **action bar** with an icon of your choice in the finished layout.  

Students should submit a report showing their research and how the principles were followed in their design. Use of screenshots and detailed explanations are required.

**Note:**

Remember that the focus is on the design rather than the implementation of the functional code base in Kotlin.  The following are considered acceptable levels of implementation:

- Basic navigation for transitioning between activities.

- Dynamically loading text and images to demonstrate the design of the app.

- Displaying dynamic images.

## Deliverables
You should submit a formal report using the following template [Link to Template TODO!](). The main body of the report should be up to 5 pages long, the appendix - up to 5 additional pages, and **must be submitted as a PDF**.

The main body of the report should have the following sections;
- abstract, 

- introduction, 

- two sections with appropriate titles for task 1 and task 2, including subsections where applicable,

- conclusion, 

- and a list of references. 

   - The list of references should be formatted following the Harvard referencing system [http://www.citethisforme.com/harvard-referencing](http://www.citethisforme.com/harvard-referencing). 
   
- The appendix should include the code for all XML files, clearly marked with their names.
