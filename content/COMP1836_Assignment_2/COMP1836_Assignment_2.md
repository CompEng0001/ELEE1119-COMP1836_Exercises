## Learning Outcomes

On completion of the assignment, the student will develop:
1. an in-depth understanding of object-oriented programming
2. understanding of the basic principles of mobile apps design
3. skills in designing a mobile app.

## The task

Mobile devices such as phones and tablets can be used for much more than just gaming, social media and communication. These devices come with a variety of sensors that can be used to sense the environment they are placed in and also the device's current condition. 

Using the phones/tablets in built-in sensors you are to create an app to measure the environment the phone is placed in, these sensors reading will be logged in an appropriate data/file storage that can be downloaded and cleared. 

The app must give the user the option of changing the sampling rates of various sensors within the limit of the SDK provided by the chosen API and device model. Additionally, the user should be able to change units of measurement. 

A simple guide/instruction should be placed within the app to help the user navigate and use the device. 


**Note: A minimal of 2 sensor readings can be programmed in each sensor group, in order pass, with specified funcitionality**

### Submission
1. Submit the project as a zip 
2. Applications .apk file, 
3. A PDF with screens shots of each activity with captions and descriptive information highlighting important concepts (must match what is shown in viva)
   1. Professional and presentable.
   2. Ensure a logical flow. 

### Deliverables for App

1. Splash activity
   1. Logo and Title (Your choice, should be appropriate and applicable to assignment)
   2. Version number of app
   3. Release date of app
   4. Last for 3.35 seconds
2. Hub activity
   1. Option to list all available sensors
   2. Phone information (at least two of the below)
      1. Make & model 
      2. Battery level
      3. Storage available
      4. Signal strength of Wifi (if connected) and/or GSM.
   3. Option to select grouping of sensor types to view information (3 groups at least and 2 sensors values per group)
      1. Motion
      2. Position
      3. Environmental
      4. Internal
3. Sensor grouping activity (minimum must choose either point 3.2 or 3.3)
   1. Upon selecting a grouping in 2.3 sensor information should be relayed to the user
   2. Option to change sampling rate should be included if applicable to the sensor
   3. Option to change units of measurement
   4. Option to record data
4. Manual/Inforation activity
   1. Simple guide on how to use the app should be included.
5. Ensure you have requested permissions for normal and dangerous Android system permissions for only the services you need.

### Deliverables for the Viva

1. Code will be commented if not easily explainable
2. Demonstration will show what functionality works in the app
3. You will turn up to the viva or recieve zero marks.
4. You will need to demonstrate that you understand the code you have submitted.
