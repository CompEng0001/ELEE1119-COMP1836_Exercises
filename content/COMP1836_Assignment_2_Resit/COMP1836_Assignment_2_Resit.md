## Learning Outcomes

On completion of the assignment, the student will develop:
1. an in-depth understanding of object-oriented programming
2. understanding of the basic principles of mobile apps design
3. skills in designing a mobile app.

## The task

Mobile devices such as phones and tablets can be used for much more than just gaming, social media and communication.
These devices come with a variety of sensors that can be used to sense the environment they are placed in and also the devices current condition.

Using the phones/tablets in built-in sensors you are to create an app to measure the environment the phone is placed in, these sensor reading will be logged in an appropriate data/file storage that can be downloaded and cleared. 

The app must give the user the option of changing the sampling rates of various sensors with in the limit of the SDK provided by the chosen API and device model. Aditionally, the user should be able to change units of measurement. 

A simple guide/instructions should be placed with in the app to help the user navigate and use the device. 

**Note: A minimal of 1 sensor readings can be programmed in each sensor group, in order pass, with specified funcitionality**

### Submission

      4. Signal strength of Wifi (if connected) and/or GSM.
   3. Option to select grouping of sensor types to view information (3 groups at least and 1 sensors values per group)
      1. Motion
      2. Position
      3. Environmental
      4. Internal
3. Sensor grouping Activity
