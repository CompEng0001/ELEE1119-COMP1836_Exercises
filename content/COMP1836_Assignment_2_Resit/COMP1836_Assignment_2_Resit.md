## Brief
The main aim of this assignment is to develop and test studentâ€™s understanding and practical skills in mobile apps design. 

The goal is to design an intuitive and functional app that allows users to record their academic grades for each module, providing a record of assessment marks. App will be able to tell student their current degree classification. The emphasis is on implementing a class-based structure, ensuring efficient data management, and incorporating persistent storage.

The assessment involves defining classes for years, modules and assessments, with specific attributes tailored to academic data representation. 

To enhance the user experience, a user interface must be developed, facilitating the addition, editing, and deletion of modules and assessments. Additionally, you are expected to implement data validation checks, ensuring the accuracy of the recorded information.

## Rubic Summary

Full rubric is at the bottom of the brief.

 - Clean Code: 25%
 - OOP: 25%
 - KDoc: 15%
 - App Design: 35%

--------------------

## Deliverables and Instructions

## Module Class

Define a `Module` class with attributes:

- name, code, level, credit
- overall mark as a percentage, and classification. 
- The module should be linked to one or more assessments. The sum of assessment weightings should exceed 100%, ensuring that combined marks do not exceed 100%.
- Allow users to add, edit, and delete modules using instances of the `Module` class. Include methods for adding assessments to each module.

## Assessment Class

Define an `Assessment` class with the following attributes:

- Name, Weighting (as a percentage), Marks achieved (out of 100)
- Ensure that assessment types are predefined, and weightings are specified in percentages.
- Create instances of the `Assessment` class to manage assessment details for each module.

## Persistent Storage

Implement a mechanism to save and load data using JSON, CSV, or XML. Choose one based on your preference and ease of implementation:

## Degree Classification Implementation

UoG Academic Council and Governing Body have stated that:

- Level 5 is worth 20% 
- Level 6 is worth 80%  
   $$\text{Overall Mark} = (0.1 \times \text{Average Marks at Level 5}) + (0.8 \times \text{Average Marks at Level 6})$$

## Overall Progress using Classes

- Utilise class instances and stored data to calculate and display overall progress classification.

- Implement validation checks within the class methods to ensure accurate data handling.

## Use KDOC

Update documentation to guide users on the new class-based structure and data storage methods.

## Design 

App should be designed to be intutitive, user friendly, accessible, suitable colour palette, font families, font size and weightings. Images where deployed should be royalty free and of good quality. Your report will provide references for these.
