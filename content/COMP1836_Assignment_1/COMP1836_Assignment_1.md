>> All submitted work will be electronically scanned for plagiarism and the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) software. The work that you submit must be your own; any material from other sources must be correctly cited and referenced. If unreferenced material is detected a student will be reported for plagiarism. If AI is used in the production of this work, university regulations require that this fact is clearly stated on the report. Use of AI which has not been acknowledged is an academic misconduct offence and again will lead to a report of plagiarism.

## Learning Outcomes

On completion of the assignment, the student will develop:
1. Understanding of the basic principles of mobile app design.
2. Skills in designing a mobile app.

## The task

This assignment consists of two tasks:

1. **Task 1**. Investigating the main principles of mobile app design using a variety of literature sources (e.g., books, journal articles, online resources). Find 5 to 10 relevant literature sources related to the main principles of mobile app design, analyse them, and write up a list of the main design principles and features that a good mobile app should have to appeal to customers. Explain how you are going to incorporate these features in the app you will be developing. 

2. **Task 2**. Design a mobile app for rental deals of your choice. Explain how you have created the design specifying the theme you have chosen, the type of layout used, and the steps taken in developing the app design.  Include a picture of the running version of the app using the emulator. 

The app should have an opening screen with the following elements: 

- A title.

- Either a drop-down list or radio buttons to choose the type of rental item.

- A dynamic ImageView.

- A TextVew and stylized button for displaying the rental item image and the lease price for the rental item chosen by the customer. 

- Specifications or details for the rental item.

- Use a theme that displays an **action bar** with an icon of your choice in the finished layout.  
  
>> The icon can be chosen from Android studio free icons’ library at e.g., [https://icon-library.com/png/544636.html](https://icon-library.com/png/544636.html). (Hint: You can find more icons’ libraries available when you type in google “android studio free icons library”).

- You must choose an API level that captures at least 70% of devices. 

## Deliverables
You should submit a formal report using the following template [https://moodlecurrent.gre.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=2620342](https://moodlecurrent.gre.ac.uk/mod/resource/view.php?id=2620342). The main body of the report should be up to 5 pages long, the appendix - up to 5 additional pages and **must be submitted as a PDF**.

The main body of the report should have the following sections;
- abstract, 
- introduction, 
- two sections with appropriate titles for task 1 and task 2, including subsections where applicable,
-  a conclusion, 
-  and a list of references. 
   -  The list of references should be formatted following the Harvard referencing system [http://www.citethisforme.com/harvard-referencing](http://www.citethisforme.com/harvard-referencing). The appendix should include the code for all XML files, clearly marked with their names.

## Marking Scheme
This first part of the assignment contributes 30% of the total coursework mark. 
The marks are distributed as follows:

1. Task 1 = 30%

2. Task 2 = 60%							

3.  Report structure and presentation = 10%
