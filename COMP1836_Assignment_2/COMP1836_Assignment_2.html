<h2 id="brief"><a class="header" href="#brief">Brief</a></h2>
<p>The main aim of this assignment is to develop and test student’s understanding and practical skills in mobile apps design.</p>
<p>In this mobile app development assessment, students are tasked with creating a comprehensive Android application using Kotlin. The goal is to design an intuitive and functional app that allows users to record their academic grades for each module, providing a record of assessment marks. App will be able to tell student their current degree classification and what they need for the next classification. The emphasis is on implementing a class-based structure, ensuring efficient data management, and incorporating persistent storage.</p>
<p>The assessment involves defining classes for years, modules and assessments, with specific attributes tailored to academic data representation.</p>
<p>To enhance the user experience, a user interface must be developed, facilitating the addition, editing, and deletion of modules and assessments. Additionally, you are expected to implement data validation checks, ensuring the accuracy of the recorded information.</p>

<p>Define a <code>Module</code> class with attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>name</li>
<li>code</li>
<li>level</li>
<li>credit</li>
<li>overall mark as a percentage, and classification.</li>
<li>The module should be linked to one or more assessments. The sum of assessment weightings should exceed 100%, ensuring that combined marks do not exceed 100%.</li>
<li>Allow users to add, edit, and delete modules using instances of the <code>Module</code> class. Include methods for adding assessments to each module.</li>

<h2 id="assessment-class"><a class="header" href="#assessment-class">Assessment Class</a></h2>
<p>Define an <code>Assessment</code> class with the following attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Weighting (as a percentage)</li>
<li>Marks achieved (out of 100)</li>
<li>Ensure that assessment types are predefined, and weightings are specified in percentages.</li>
